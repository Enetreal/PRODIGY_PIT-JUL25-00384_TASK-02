# Stopwatch Web Application

A simple and intuitive web-based stopwatch application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to accurately measure time with functionalities for starting, stopping, and resetting the timer.

##  Features

* **Start Button:** Begins the stopwatch timer.
* **Stop Button:** Pauses the stopwatch timer, retaining the current time.
* **Reset Button:** Resets the stopwatch to zero, clearing any elapsed time.
* **Lap Functionality (Optional/Future Enhancement):** Record lap times without stopping the main timer.
* **Responsive Design:** Adapts to various screen sizes for a consistent user experience on desktop and mobile devices. (Add this if your CSS includes responsive design)
* **Clear Time Display:** Displays time in a clear and readable format (e.g., HH:MM:SS.MS).

##  Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Provides the structural foundation of the stopwatch interface.
* **CSS3:** Styles the stopwatch for a clean and user-friendly appearance.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Implements all the core logic for timing, button interactions, and display updates.
